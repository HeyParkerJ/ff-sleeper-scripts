* Scratchpad
** When creating a CSV of data for consumption for excel. A potential mental model for optimizing looping
- Season (has many)
- Weeks (has many)
- Matchups (has two)
- Managers - Who all have:
  + Opponent
  + Score
  + PointsAgainst
  + isWinner

All high level objects in the tree above can be looped over and their value in the loop passed on to the next level.

- Season (has many)
  + Loop at the point where we fetch the seasons from Sleeper
- Weeks (has many)
  + Loop inside a high level "perform work" function
- Matchups (has two)
  + Loop underneath
- Managers - Who all have:
  + Opponent
  + Score
  + PointsAgainst
  + isWinner

* Roadmap
** TODO - Pull in the following Sleeper APIs
- [ ] League settings
  GET https://api.sleeper.app/v1/league/<league_id>
