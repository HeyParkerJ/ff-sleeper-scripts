* Fantasy Football Sleeper Scripts

This is a project I use to run data calculations on Sleeper's API and gather interesting data for my fantasy league. I only have a faint idea of the direction I will be taking this, so this readme is intentionally light right now. To get a rough idea of what I have planned, look in [project.org](project.org).

This was bootstraped with Robin Wieruch's
[[https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-node-js-babel-setup][minimal-node-js-babel-setup]]

** Installation
#+begin_src sh
 git clone https://github.com/HeyParkerJ/ff-sleeper-scripts.git
 cd ff-sleeper-scripts
 npm install
 npm run dev
 # OR
 npm run start
#+end_src

There is also support for saving mock responses of any of Sleeper's API calls so we don't spam them in dev. To rebuild the mocks, run
#+begin_src
npm run write:mocks
#+end_src
