# Fantasy Football Sleeper Scripts

This is a project I use to run data calculations on Sleeper's API and gather interesting data for my fantasy league. I only have a faint idea of the direction I will be taking this, so this readme is intentionally light right now. To get a rough idea of what I have planned, look in [project.org](project.org).

This was bootstraped with Robin Wieruch's [minimal-node-js-babel-setup](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-node-js-babel-setup)

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/HeyParkerJ/ff-sleeper-scripts.git`
* `cd ff-sleeper-scripts`
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
* OR
* `npm run start`

There is also support for saving mock responses of any of Sleeper's API calls so we don't spam them in dev. To rebuild the mocks, run

* `npm run write:mocks`
