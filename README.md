# Fantasy Football Sleeper Scripts

This is a project I use to run data calculations on Sleeper's API and gather interesting data for my fantasy league. I only have a faint idea of the direction I will be taking this, so this readme is intentionally light right now. To get a rough idea of what I have planned, look in [project.org](project.org).

This was bootstraped with Robin Wieruch's [minimal-node-js-babel-setup](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-node-js-babel-setup)

## Installation

* `git clone git@github.com:rwieruch/minimal-node-application.git`
